      <h3>Next meeting</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Date/time:</b> Feb 27th 2018, 19:00</br>
        <b>Location:</b> <a href="https://www.tuesdaycoworking.com">tuesday coworking</a> (Feurigstr. 51)</a></br>
        <b>Topic:</b> Lorenzo will talk about nonsmooth optimization using
	proximal algorithms in Julia, in particular his work on the packages <a
	href="https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl">ProximalOperators.jl</a>
	and <a href="https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalAlgorithms.jl">ProximalAlgorithms.jl</a>.
	The first one implements first order primitives for a variety of
	functions that can be used to express problems, the second one relies on
	the first and contains generic implementations of various well-known
	iterative methods in convex optimization.</br>
        <b>RSVP: </b>On <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Julia-Users-Group/">our meetup page</a></br>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p> Julia Users Group - Berlin had its first get together in 2015. Since June 2016 we've tried to meet up
        every two months for a discussion about Julia and our related projects.
      </p>
        <p>
          We have a full list of our <a href=previous_talks.html>previous meetings</a> and their topics.
         </p>
         <p>
           If you are interested in joining us please subscribe to our <a href=http://eepurl.com/dmi7Wz>announcements list</a>.
           We are currently moving away from using meetup.com.
         </p>


      <h3>Inclusiveness statement</h3>
      <p>It seems unfortunate to have to make this statement but the computing world is not always know for its inclusivity or diversity.
        We are commited to welcoming anyone who is interested in joining our meet-up and will do our best to learn to communicate with
        them in a manner which makes them feel a full member of our community without the barriers of rank, background, gender, colour or
        other distinction.
      </p>
