## Inclusiveness statement

*It seems unfortunate to have to make this statement but the computing world is not always know for its inclusivity or diversity. We are commited to welcoming anyone who is interested in joining our meet-up and will do our best to learn to communicate with them in a manner which makes them feel a full member of our community without the barriers of rank, background, gender, colour or other distinction.*
