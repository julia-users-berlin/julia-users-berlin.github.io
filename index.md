## Upcoming events

Our next meetup may take place on **January 20th** at 6:30 or 7pm.     

It's still uncertain, if there is enough interest in the January meetup, so if you intend to join, please say so on [Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/249782-berlinusergroup") by 4pm. If you are unable to access Zulip, you can check this site again at 5pm for a final decision.

As usual, at [WIAS](https://www.wias-berlin.de/). The main entrance is currently closed due to construction work, so you will have to enter from the back .

At the entrance, there is a registration book for guests. Enter Dr. Fuhrmann as the person to be visited.

## Inclusiveness statement

*It seems unfortunate to have to make this statement but the computing world is not always know for its inclusivity or diversity. We are commited to welcoming anyone who is interested in joining our meet-up and will do our best to learn to communicate with them in a manner which makes them feel a full member of our community without the barriers of rank, background, gender, colour or other distinction.*
