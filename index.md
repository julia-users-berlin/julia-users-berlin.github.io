| 27.02.2018 | Tuesday coworking | Lorenzo talked about nonsmooth optimization using proximal algorithms in Julia, in particular his work on the packages [ProximalOperators.jl](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl) and [ProximalAlgorithms.jl](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalAlgorithms.jl). The first one implements first order primitives for a variety of functions that can be used to express problems, the second one relies on the first and contains generic implementations of various well-known iterative methods in convex optimization. He also told us of his plans to develop a generic mathematical modelling language for numerical optimisation tasks. | [tuesday coworking](www.tuesdaycoworking.com) |
| 05.12.2017 | Meet-up | David gave an overall introduction to the [JuliaGPU](https://github.com/JuliaGPU) project, with a focus on [OpenCL](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/OpenCL.jl). Simon followed this with an introduction to the [GPUArrays](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl) interface and [CLArrays](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CLArrays.jl), which he has worked on, as simple ways to offload your matrix arithmetic to the GPU | The Factory Berlin |
| 07.11.2017 | Meet-up | Dirk presented [his work on TransitmapSolver.jl](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/TransitmapSolver.jl), which is used to [draw transit maps](https://github.com/public-transport/generating-transit-maps) automatically. Simon gave us an update on [GLVisualize](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl). | The Factory Berlin |
| 30.06.2017 | Talks | David and Robert gave a workshop on [Julia for Data Science](https://github.com/daveh19/pydataberlin2017). Hector gave a talk on his [Shearlets](https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl) toolbox. | PyData Berlin 2017 |
| 24.04.2017 | Meet-up | Robert presented an overview of optimisation tools which fall under the [JuliaOpt](http://www.juliaopt.org/) umbrella. Following this he went into detail on [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl), a package to which he is a contributor.|  The Factory Berlin |
| 27.02.2017 | Meet-up | Hector spoke about using Julia for mathematical applications, using his Julia packages for [Wavelets](https://github.com/arsenal9971/FWT.jl) and [Shearlets](https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl), in a talk entitled *Filter-based implementation of Fast Wavelet and Shearlet transform in Julia*. We also briefly discussed our plans for hosting an Introduction to Julia workshop aimed at numerically literate users. And we had an informal overview discussion of parallelisation using Julia. | The Factory Berlin |
| 06.12.2016 | Meet-up | Simon introduced [GLVisualize](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl) meanwhile Cristina demonstrated [Molcajete.jl](https://github.com/xmunoz/Molcajete.jl) a program which she wrote for accessing the Meet-up API in order to schedule non-clashing meet-ups. We also had our first disucssion of plans for hosting an introduction to Julia workshop. | The Factory Berlin |
| 03.10.2016| Meet-up | Robert presented the [Plots](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl) package and Vinny introduced us to some machine learning applications and embedding in a jupyter dashboard. | The Factory Berlin |
| 18.08.2016 | Meet-up | David presented a neuronal network simulator, written entirely in Julia. The focus was on what design choices were enforced/enabled by the use of Julia | The Factory Berlin |
| 09.06.2016 | Meet-up | Our kick-off meeting, following PyData 2016. [Miles Lubin](http://www.mit.edu/~mlubin/), co-author of [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) library and a founder of [JuliaOpt](https://github.com/JuliaOpt), was visiting and attended. We discussed a number of topics about the state of Julia, the development behind the scenes, of course some numerical optimisation topics, and the organisation of the meet-up. | St. Oberholz (Rosenthaler Platz) |
| 21.05.2016 | Talk | David gave a talk on [Julia for Python programmers](https://pydata.org/berlin2016/schedule/presentation/15/). | PyData Berlin 2016 |
| 26.03.2015 | Meet-up | Our very first meet-up in Berlin. [Viral Shah](https://github.com/viralbshah) was in Germany on business and attended. [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch) also made the trip to Berlin, and has subsequently moved here to join us more permanently. We had a great night, but the reality of organising a regular meet-up with so few members meant that it took another 15 months before the next meeting occured. | St. Oberholz (Rosenthaler Platz) |

## Inclusiveness statement

It seems unfortunate to have to make this statement but the computing world is not always know for its inclusivity or diversity. We are commited to welcoming anyone who is interested in joining our meet-up and will do our best to learn to communicate with them in a manner which makes them feel a full member of our community without the barriers of rank, background, gender, colour or other distinction.
